"# appz" 
appz is a basic Python-based chat application with a unique approach to user accounts. Instead of requiring users to manually create an account, the system automatically generates one based on the user's hardware — specifically, the motherboard serial number. This ensures that each device can only register a single account, adding a layer of identity control and uniqueness to the platform.


🔧 Key Features
Auto-generated user accounts based on hardware ID (motherboard serial).

No manual sign-up or password required.

Python-based backend.

(Optional) Local or LAN-based messaging system using socket and threading.
